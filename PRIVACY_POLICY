3. How We Share Your Information
does not share, sell, or transmit your information to any third parties. The application is designed to process data locally on your device, ensuring that all data collected from YouTube and Twitch chat services remains private and secure within the app itself. Since there is no backend service or external data transmission, your information is never shared or exposed outside your local environment.
4. Data Security
At WheelOfNamesHelper, we prioritize the security and privacy of user data. Since our application is designed as a desktop app without a backend service, all data processing occurs locally on your device. This means:

* Local Data Processing: All data collected from YouTube’s Live Chat API and Twitch chat is processed and displayed solely within the app on your device. No data is transmitted to external servers owned or managed by us.
* Temporary Data Storage: Any data retrieved from YouTube and Twitch (e.g., live chat messages and channel information) is stored in the app's memory during the session and is not saved to your device or transmitted externally. Once the app is closed, all data is cleared and permanently deleted.
* Secure API Integration: We use secure methods for connecting to YouTube’s APIs, ensuring that your data is protected during transmission between these services and your app.
* Minimal Permissions: WheelOfNamesHelper only requests permissions necessary for accessing live chat and broadcast data from YouTube and Twitch to minimize potential risks.
* User Responsibility: While we take all feasible steps to secure data within the app, we recommend users keep their devices protected with standard security practices (e.g., using updated antivirus software and strong passwords).

By relying solely on client-side processing and not involving any backend data storage or transmission, WheelOfNamesHelper minimizes the potential for external data breaches and enhances user control over their data.

5. Data Retention
WheelOfNamesHelper does not store any user data beyond the session duration. Any live chat data collected during a session is temporary and is not retained after the app is closed.

6. Third-Party Services
